      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough. Croissants are named for their historical crescent shape,
      the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded several times in
      succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
      laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a
      puff pastry.
      <br /><br />
      Crescent-shaped breads have been made since the Renaissance, and
      crescent-shaped cakes possibly since antiquity but using brioche dough.
      Kipferls have long been a staple of Austrian, and French bakeries and
      p√¢tisseries. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th century
      when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl with a
      yeast-leavened laminated dough.[3] In the late 1970s, the development of
      factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
      food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery,
      notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
      American-style fast food,[4] and as of 2008, 30‚Äì40% of the croissants sold
      in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough.
      <br /><br />
      Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European
      countries.
